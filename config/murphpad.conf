# How long before the board goes idle, which turns off RGB and the OLED (ms). 300000 ms = 5 min.
CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_TIMEOUT=300000

# Enable deep sleep.
# In deep sleep the board will also disconnect from Bluetooth and cut external power.
# It may take several seconds for a board to wake from deep sleep after a key is pressed.
CONFIG_ZMK_SLEEP=y
# How long the board will stay in idle mode before going to deep sleep (ms). 3600000 ms = 1 hour.

### RGB SETTINGS ###

# Enable RGB - change in tandem
CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW=y
CONFIG_WS2812_STRIP=y

# When set to 'n', turning off RGB will NOT cut power to the board VCC pin.
# This impacts battery life as the LEDs draw significant power even when "off".
#
# Change to 'y' if:
# A. OLED VCC has been connected to board RAW instead
# - or -
# B. You don't mind that turning off RGB also turns off the OLED
CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW_EXT_POWER=n

# Keep RGB on when the keyboard goes idle.
CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW_AUTO_OFF_IDLE=y

# Should disconnection from USB turn off RGB?
